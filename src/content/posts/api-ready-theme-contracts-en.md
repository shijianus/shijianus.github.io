# Why Start with a Contract

If every section of a theme reads raw data directly in the templates, switching from local Markdown to an API later would require rewriting almost every page.

## Current Approach

This time I extracted these capabilities into a unified helper:

- Post sorting
- Archive aggregation
- Category aggregation
- Tag aggregation
- Related post recommendations

## Benefits of This Approach

When the data source changes, theoretically you only need to replace the data entry point, not modify the UI components themselves.

## Implications for Theme Extensibility

This means that future integrations such as:

- Custom dashboard API
- External search API
- Remote article summary service

won’t require tearing apart the current component layer and rebuilding it.
