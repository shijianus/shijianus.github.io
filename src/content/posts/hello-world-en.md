# Why Rebuild

The biggest issue with the previous implementation wasn't a lack of features, but unclear structure. The pages mixed experimental branding, styling, and isolated components, ending up looking neither like the original theme nor forming a coherent order.

## Criteria for This Refactor

This theme refactor has two premises:

1. Preserve the strengths of the original theme's robust homepage, sidebar modules, and card system.  
2. Fully switch the implementation to a content‑first architecture using Astro, React, and Tailwind.

```ts
const themeContract = {
  brand: 'shijianus',
  runtime: 'Astro Islands',
  interaction: ['loading', 'copy-code', 'comments', 'dock'],
};
```

## What the Homepage Should Address First

The homepage isn’t a marketing page; it’s primarily an information map. When readers land on the first page, they need to quickly see:

- Brand and author identity
- Current primary categories
- Recently noteworthy articles
- Where to navigate next via the sidebar

## Future Direction

All subsequent sections will continue to be adjusted around a single goal: to make this theme feel technical yet not alienate ordinary readers.
